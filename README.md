# RebusDemos

This demo code was used in its original form (the projects residing in the "old" folder) at the GOTO Aarhus
conference in 2013.

The updated form was used in 2016 in a guest lecture on the "Middleware and Communication Protocols for Dependable Systems"
course at Aarhus University, and in 2017 in a Barcelona .NET Core meetup.

The demos are:

* [Demo0](/Demo0) - demonstrates a very simple client that sends a string to a server
* [Demo1](/Demo1) - shows how a fictional Trading endpoint can publish events, which can be subscribed to by the Billing endpoint
* [Demo2](/Demo2) - introduces an external HTTP-based credit assessment service, which is fairly unstable
* [Demo3](/Demo3) - uses a saga to coordinate the invoicing flow
